- Configurable upload directory location (path)
- Get rid of so many constants and switch to configuration / Application
- Some things are not named and placed properly (eg. PictshareModel - which is not a model)
- Routing could be better, and so could controllers
- Container bootstrapping inside Application
- Switch from using Config(Interface) objects everywhere to using 'config' helper function?
